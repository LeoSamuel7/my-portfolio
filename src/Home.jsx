        I'm a <span className="font-bold">Computer Engineer</span> with a passion for building intelligent systems that merge hardware and software.
        From designing ultrasonic transponders to developing fuzzy logic based license plate readers, I like working where signals, sensors, and software meet
        (turning abstract ideas into real-world systems). Whether I'm adjusting a transponder circuit or refining a fuzzy logic model, Iâ€™m motivated by projects
        that require both creative thinking and technical precision, especially when they lead to real-world impact.
